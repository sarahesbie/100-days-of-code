# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Sarah Brown

### Day 1: April 06, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**:

- Finished the setup for my 100 Days of Code Github repo (does that count? lol)
- Installed AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface on my machine (for work)
- Researched getting started with a Python "Rock Paper Scissors" game

**Thoughts:**
Day one... I think I copped out a bit today, but I feel like I was getting myself organised. I spent a bit of time 'window shopping' researching projects I might try (here are some ideas: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). I need to find a way to prioritise this and/or find a good routine.

### Day 2: April 07, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**:

- Started Python 'Rock Paper Scissors' Game
  - Created repo
  - Added starter code
- Started Udacity Intro to Python from scratch, lesson one: Turtles and Code!

**Thoughts:**
I started playing around in the Rock Paper Scissors starter code as a way to get back into Python. I'm VERY rusty. I'm going back to the v e r y beginning because I really want to get the fundamentals down. I'm now working through the Udacity Intro to Python modules from the very start.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
