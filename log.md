# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Sarah Brown

### Day 5: APril 10, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**:
This was a public holiday, so... I didn't really acheive anything. If it counts, I played this [Code a Cake](https://www.bt.com/codeacake/) game, and with the Code Like a Girl [Easter Bug Scavenger Hunt](https://puzzles.codelikeagirl.com/puzzles/scavenger-hunt) game.

### Day 4: April 09, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**:
Thursday is the day I've been live-streaming on Twitch with Code Like a Girl, building a website called 'CatMatch' for the purposes of demonstrating HTML & CSS basics.

- Added more content and structure to the HTML page
- Added colour blocks, margins and padding, and Google fonts
- Added a favicon

**Thoughts:**
So far this website has been reeeeally simple HTML and CSS, but I'm really keen to continue building this site as a portfolio piece. I'm definitely going to bring some Javascript into it, and maybe even eventually attach it to a database with an API. The 'purpose' of the website is to connect people to cats via video conference (for those, like me, with allergies), so it's kinda dumb but also, I would totally use it. Explaining what I'm doing as I'm doing it is a really great way for me to solidify my skills, and it's a way for me to really get into my 'back end' skill development.

### Day 3: April 08, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**:

- Screen-sharing session with tech mentor - running through modifying a record or adding a record to a database via a Rails console
- Half an hour of Udacity Intro to Python course
  - Progress: Intro to Python, Part One: Lesson One Turtles and Code: 7. Changing Shapes

**Thoughts:**
A lot of 'learning' via tutorials and tutors today. It would be nice to 'just jump into writing code' but I don't think that's super realistic.

### Day 2: April 07, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**:

- Started Python 'Rock Paper Scissors' Game
  - Created repo
  - Added starter code
- Started Udacity Intro to Python from scratch, lesson one: Turtles and Code!

**Thoughts:**
I started playing around in the Rock Paper Scissors starter code as a way to get back into Python. I'm VERY rusty. I'm going back to the v e r y beginning because I really want to get the fundamentals down. I'm now working through the Udacity Intro to Python modules from the very start.

### Day 1: April 06, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**:

- Finished the setup for my 100 Days of Code Github repo (does that count? lol)
- Installed AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface on my machine (for work)
- Researched getting started with a Python "Rock Paper Scissors" game

**Thoughts:**
Day one... I think I copped out a bit today, but I feel like I was getting myself organised. I spent a bit of time 'window shopping' researching projects I might try (here are some ideas: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). I need to find a way to prioritise this and/or find a good routine.
