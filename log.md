# 100 Days Of Code - Log - Sarah Brown

### Day 24: May 01, 2020 (Friday)

CSS Animations

- Started a just-for-fun project for visualising the 'square breathing' technique (breathe in, hold, breath out, hold)
- Working with CSS animations to create a 'bubble' that follows the square in four-second intervals.
- This is a WIP - I'll come back to it for sure, and maybe experiment with some other visualisations.
- Next steps: tidy up the code, make sure the timing is right, adjust the colour palette, add text to prompt breathing

**Thoughts**
It's really hard to dedicate one hour to writing code every single day. Especially if you're not supposed to count work. How are people supposed to work, eat regularly, walk 10,000 steps, spend time with people you like, read books, and be outside... AND spend an hour every day coding? I get that it's a challenge, and perhaps I'm not taking it _seriously_ enough. But, I don't really think that I need to.

With that in mind, today I decided to have some fun with this and play with CSS animations.

### Day 17: April 24, 2020 (Friday)

Fun with Ruby:

- Installing Ruby on my computer
- Trying to make Ruby work on VS Code (sort of succeeding?)
- Finding an [online IDE](https://repl.it/repls) and tinkering with it
- Reading through [documentation on how to make a text-based adventure game with Ruby](https://jsrn.gitbooks.io/make-your-first-text-adventure-in-ruby/content/index.html) and starting to tinker in the online IDE

**Thoughts**
I'd love to have someone run me through how to actually get this up and running! I should ask around to see if someone is willing to coach me.

### Day 16: April 23, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**:
I'm counting the coding and software configuration I did for work towards today's 100 Days of Code challenge :P
I was working on a Gitbook instance for some software documentation for my work. Fairly easy stuff, but new to me, so it was a learning challenge.

- Set up a [Gitbook](https://gitlab.com/pages/gitbook) instance in GitLab
- Started creating pages in my GitBook

Next step is to work out how to deploy my [Gitbook to a Netlify host](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/12/08/a-step-by-step-guide-gitbook-on-netlify/) so that people can see it. Not sure if I can do this as it's a private repository. TBA.

### Day 15: April 22, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**:
Continued through Ruby tutorial on Codecademy.
Concepts covered:

- Control Flow:
  - `if`, `else`, and `elsif` statements
  - relational operators `==, !=, <, <=, >, >=`
  - boolean/logical operators `&&, ||, !`
  - `unless` statement
- `include?` method (return true or false if a string does or doesn't include something)

**Today's Progress**:
Definitely didn't do an hour. Eep.

- Tinkered with the 'Let's Get Away' arrangement on Sonic Pi

**Link(s) to work**: [Let's Get Away Song arrangement repo](https://github.com/sarahesbie/lets-get-away-arrangement)

**Thoughts**
I still feel like I'm a little bit all over the place. Maybe I should create a 'running projects list' in this github repo. That's a job for next week I think.

### Day 9: April 16, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**:
I took part in a Sonic Pi workshop today - tinkered with the basics of Sonic Pi & started working on an arrangement of a song written by a friend of mine.

### Day 8: April 15, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**:
Copping out today and counting my work done on the job for the 100 Day Challenge :)
All React JS:

- fixed a text field that was not accepting a value
- filtered items out of a list based on their attributes
- fixed attributes not printing on front end in activity log items

### Day 7: April 14, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**:
Kept it simple with continuing Intro to Python. Worked through the following concepts:

- errors in Python
- modules & methods
- comments in Python
- sequencing
- using variables
- looping

### Day 6: April 13, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**:
Continued work on WordPress secret art project I'm doing with a few friends. Not strictly coding but definitely software development.

- researched how to connect a GitHub repository to Cpanel for WP theme and plugin development (TODO)
- played with post formats in functions.php
- configured user signup via BuddyPress & tested

### Day 6: April 11, 2020 (Saturday)

Continued work on WordPress secret art project I'm doing with a few friends. Not strictly coding but definitely software development.

- Configured remote mail server to allow mail to be sent
- Moved WordPress install to a live host

### Day 6: April 11, 2020 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress**:
I started work on a WordPress project for a _secret art project_ I'm doing with some of my friends. Not strictly coding but definitely software development.

- Started tinkering with BuddyPress on a Wordpress installation
- playing with themes and plugins

### Day 5: April 10, 2020 (Friday)

**Today's Progress**:
This was a public holiday, so... I didn't really acheive anything. If it counts, I played this [Code a Cake](https://www.bt.com/codeacake/) game, and with the Code Like a Girl [Easter Bug Scavenger Hunt](https://puzzles.codelikeagirl.com/puzzles/scavenger-hunt) game.

### Day 4: April 09, 2020 (Thursday)

**Today's Progress**:
Thursday is the day I've been live-streaming on Twitch with Code Like a Girl, building a website called 'CatMatch' for the purposes of demonstrating HTML & CSS basics.

- Added more content and structure to the HTML page
- Added colour blocks, margins and padding, and Google fonts
- Added a favicon

**Thoughts:**
So far this website has been reeeeally simple HTML and CSS, but I'm really keen to continue building this site as a portfolio piece. I'm definitely going to bring some Javascript into it, and maybe even eventually attach it to a database with an API. The 'purpose' of the website is to connect people to cats via video conference (for those, like me, with allergies), so it's kinda dumb but also, I would totally use it. Explaining what I'm doing as I'm doing it is a really great way for me to solidify my skills, and it's a way for me to really get into my 'back end' skill development.

### Day 3: April 08, 2020 (Wednesday)

**Today's Progress**:

- Screen-sharing session with tech mentor - running through modifying a record or adding a record to a database via a Rails console
- Half an hour of Udacity Intro to Python course
  - Progress: Intro to Python, Part One: Lesson One Turtles and Code: 7. Changing Shapes

**Thoughts:**
A lot of 'learning' via tutorials and tutors today. It would be nice to 'just jump into writing code' but I don't think that's super realistic.

### Day 2: April 07, 2020 (Tuesday)

**Today's Progress**:

- Started Python 'Rock Paper Scissors' Game
  - Created repo
  - Added starter code
- Started Udacity Intro to Python from scratch, lesson one: Turtles and Code!

**Thoughts:**
I started playing around in the Rock Paper Scissors starter code as a way to get back into Python. I'm VERY rusty. I'm going back to the v e r y beginning because I really want to get the fundamentals down. I'm now working through the Udacity Intro to Python modules from the very start.

**Link(s) to work**: [Rock Paper Scissors python repository](https://github.com/sarahesbie/rock-paper-scissors-python)

### Day 1: April 06, 2020 (Monday)

**Today's Progress**:

- Finished the setup for my 100 Days of Code Github repo (does that count? lol)
- Installed AWS Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface on my machine (for work)
- Researched getting started with a Python "Rock Paper Scissors" game

**Thoughts:**
Day one... I think I copped out a bit today, but I feel like I was getting myself organised. I spent a bit of time 'window shopping' researching projects I might try (here are some ideas: https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). I need to find a way to prioritise this and/or find a good routine.
